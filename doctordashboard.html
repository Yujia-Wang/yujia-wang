                        <p class="text-align">With emerging technology rapidly growing and changing, it’s constantly changing the way we live and work. For healthcare providers, to provide outstanding healthcare service, it’s necessary to stay up-to-date with their technologies, since we rely so much on devices and applications to provide medical services. However, there are still a lot of medical practices attempting to get through the day by using a paper-based system. The problem is there’s no perfect solutions to suit every practice due to the various needs based on different practices and specialities. Thus, an all-in-one doctor management platform is in demand.</p>

                        <p class="text-align">For this design challenge, the solution only covers the dashboard part and the customization part. Here are some major features:</p>

                            <li>Message - get timely message notification.</li>
                            <li>Billing - get the big picture of the business trend.</li>
                            <li>Chat - quick access for plastic surgeons to communicate with patients.</li>
                            <li>Clinical tool - quick access to efficient tools and comprehensive resources.</li>

                        <h4 class="tiny-space2">WHY AM I BUILDING THIS?</h4>
                        <p class="text-align">An all-in-one doctor management platform can help providers improve work productivity. It can provide better healthcare for patients, and eventually leads to achieve company’s business goals. More specifically,</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12 text-center">
                        <img class="pic-space pic-bottom-space" src="image/doctordashboard/benefit.jpg" width="100%" alt="benefit">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p class="text-align">From the business side, since this will be an all-in-one application, it embraces all users. Thus, it creates more business opportunities for the company.</p>
                        <p class="text-align">However, depending on the practice size and the specialities, different providers and different doctors may have different needs. To make a better solution for everyone, the functionality of flexible customizations becomes very essential. Moreover, the information and the process that doctors need can be very complex and tedious. Thus, a better management for these information and workflows is in demand.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row tiny-space1">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <h4 class="tiny-space2">WHO AM I BUILDING IT FOR?</h4>
                        <p class="text-align">Since this all-in-one doctor management platform covers a lot of related topics, it’s suitable for a wide range of potential users. Here I defined 4 types of typical user groups.</p>
                        <ul class="text-align" style="padding-left: 17px">
                            <li>Healthcare provider managers who need to know and manage their business.</li>
                            <li>Nurses who need to manage patients’ profiles and collaborate with doctors.</li>
                            <li>Lab scientists who need to manage medical tests.</li>
                            <li>Doctors who need to perform medical diagnosis and manager their daily work.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-align">More specifically, these user groups can still be separated into different groups based on different classifications. For example, based on practice size, it can be separated into small practices and large practices. For doctors, depending on their specialities, they may have very different user needs. For this design challenge, I will take plastic surgeons and dermatologists for example, with demonstrations of doctors’ general needs.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row tiny-space1">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <h4 class="tiny-space2">WHEN AND WHERE WILL IT BE USED?</h4>
                        <p class="text-align">After defining the target user groups, I need to better understand their context and problems when they are using an EHR-centered management platform. I conducted some literature review and interviews with 5 doctors. Here are some interesting findings:</p>
                        <ul class="text-align" style="padding-left: 17px">
                            <li>Almost every provider will use online appointment system. Depending on the providers, it can be a self-register kiosk, a tablet application, or an appointment app.</li>
                            <li>Medical form and other types of forms can vary a lot among different providers. Each provider will create their own template based on their needs.</li>
                            <li>They initial process of treating patients is very similar among different doctors of specialities. For example, they would check the EHR of the patients, and ask them about basic information, such as family health history, allergy history, etc.</li>
                            <li>Although the initial process may be very similar, depending on the different specialities of doctors, the information they care about can be quite different. For example, compared with other types of doctors, dermatologists rely more on pathological pictures. Thus, they would need more clinical tools.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-align">Then, I created an affinity mapping to organize my interview data.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12 text-center">

                        <p class="text-align">After the affinity mapping, I identified several user needs of target user groups.</p>

                        <p class="text-align">Ideally, the service we provide will perform better when using website application, mobile application and tablet application at the same time. It creates a better collaborative environment. However, considering the real situations, some providers may not have the resources to equip each doctor with a tablet, and mobile application is not suitable for complex work. Thus, it leaves the website application to be the most suitable platform to hold all our services since it’s more likely that every provider can provide each doctor with a computer or a laptop.</p>

                        <p class="text-align">For an integrated customization section, since customization is really important for our all-in-one management platform, it has a higher priority compared with other similar platforms. It seems fair enough to create a special section for customization function. However, it might break the visual connections between the real part and customizations.</p>
                        <p class="text-align">In terms of the other option, we have so many places that can be customized, such as medical forms, dashboard, and EHR. Almost every part should be customized based on different needs of different roles. It might be more intuitive and convenient for users to access the customization function through each part. However, users usually only need to customize once at the very beginning. After the first setting, the customization functionality starts losing its priority. It seems not worthy to distribute the customization and increase the complexity.</p>
                        <p class="text-align">To tackle this dilemma, I conducted an expert review session to acquire feedback. As a result, experts prefer the first option since customization has a higher priority. Moreover, distributing customizations might be hard for users to find the right place to customize. Also, users may have the need to constantly customize their forms until they think it’s perfect. In this case, it would be convenient for users to access the customization functionality quickly.</p>

                        <h4 class="tiny-space2">CHALLENGE - WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR THE CUSTOMIZATION</h4>
                        <p class="text-align">There are many different ways to design a customization system. For this project, I had two options: the traditional setting mode and the drag & drop setting mode. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p class="text-align">Traditional setting mode is easier to operate. It usually needs users to switch the options and adjust their display orders. However, it seems not customizable enough in terms of certain sections. For example, what if a dermatologist needs to add a section of patient’s skin condition in their EHR but we don’t provide the settings for this section. In this case, drag and drop setting mode seems more flexible. It offers more options for customizations. Also, to make the best use of drag & drop setting mode, I added two more major features: preview and template.</p>
